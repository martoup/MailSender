# MailSender
MailSender is simple RESTfull mail sending application. It combines the services of different email providers. 
Currently there are 3 providers implemented - [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/user/signup), [Mailgun](http://www.mailgun.com) and [Mandrill](https://mandrillapp.com) but more can be added easily. If one of the services goes down, MailSender failovers to another provider guaranteeing email delivery.
